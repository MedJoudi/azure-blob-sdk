#Azure Storage SDK for .NET
##Overview
This repository contains code and instructions for Lab 03, which focuses on retrieving Azure Storage resources and metadata using the Azure Storage SDK for .NET. The lab guides you through accessing Azure Storage containers within a C# application, retrieving metadata, exposing URI information, and implementing secure access.

Note: Due to the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, the Azure user interface (UI) might change, impacting the alignment of lab instructions with the UI. Be prepared to adapt to any UI changes encountered during the lab.

##Lab Scenario
In this lab, you will learn to use the Azure Storage SDK to interact with Azure Storage containers in a C# application. The key tasks include:

*Creating Azure resources, specifically a Storage account.
*Uploading a blob into a container within the Storage account.
*Accessing containers and blobs using the .NET SDK.
*Retrieving blob Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) through the SDK.
*Testing the blob URI in a browser.

##Instructions
Follow the detailed instructions provided in the LabGuide.md file. The guide includes step-by-step instructions for each exercise, helping you navigate through the tasks efficiently.
